# Welcome to Group 1 Game
Our Game Group Project! This is an open source project for students in ***Group 1 in IT 115 class at North Seattle College***,
but welcome for everyone's contribution. We appreciate it.

Our group develops an adventure text game. The player wakes up at an empty room and he/she is not sure what to do next.
Player has four options to go forward, backward, left or right.

Player decides to go forward --> Welcome player to go to an adventure room of Group 1. This repo is for group 1 (forward) only.

What will player see in the dark room without any windows?

Let us know your answer and feel free to contribute your creative ideas to our team.

## Environment Details
Part of the class is to explore different development enviroments. This repository will be for code contributions from all group members.
This is the directory for group 1. Each group member contribute code to this directory.
The repo already gave access to all group members as collaborators to access and manage the whole directory.
However, in order to make the main repo deployable at anytime, please set up branches before editing, and seek other collaboartors' reviews before putting the
changes to the main.
This is going to be a web application. The directory structure will work like a tree.

## Testing
You can test the latest version of The Game at this URL:(Will be provided soon)
Before we put html files in the repo, we use validator to screen all the bugs.
And we also install and use super-Linter to catch the bugs. All the bugs found are posted in bug report for follow up.
After upload the files, we use github page to test the project before deploy in AWS server.
Our current testing procedure is to click on each link and check for broken links and missing pages.

    <p><b>Ghost:</b> SEEECOND QUESTION!</p>
    <p><b>Ghost:</b> Who was your first love?</p>
<br>
     <p><i>Again you hesitate...</i></p>
     <p><i>You tried remembering before and nothing came to your mind. But all of a sudden...</i></p>
    <p>It's spring, you are in a park.</p>
    <p>You see a girl.</p>
    <p>She is so pretty you cannot take your eyes off her.</p>
    <p>She is running around playfully in a flowy dress, but fixes you with her beautiful eyes while giggling.</p>
    <p>You give her flowers.</p>
    <p>She kisses you on your lips as a thank you.</p>
    <p>You close your eyes for a second to feel the moment.</p>
    <p>But the girl dissappears.</p>

<h1>The end</h1>

    <p><b>Ghost:</b> You see, at times I get so lonely that I want a companion.</p>
    <p><b>You:</b> So you brought me here?</p>
    <p><b>Ghost:</b> You are a silly one. I sometimes think of silly things too.</p>
    <p><b>Ghost:</b> How can I bring you here when I can't even leave this room. </p>
    <p><b>You:</b> So how did I get in here?</p>
    <p><b>Ghost:</b> Remember all those stories you told me about?</p>
    <p><b>You:</b> I didn't tell you a word...</p>
    <p><b>Ghost:</b> Yes.. but I knew all those things, but I like to remind myself of them sometimes. </p>
    <p><b>You:</b> How do you know so much about my life?</p>
    <p><b>Ghost:</b> Your life?! I was there.</p>
    <p><b>You:</b> I don't understand...</p>
    <p><b>Ghost:</b> You see, you and I are one and the same. </p>
    <p><b>Ghost:</b> I've created you, just like I've created a million more of you before.</p>
    <p><b>Ghost:</b> You are just a part of my imagination that helps me cope with this loneliness. </p>
    <p><b>Ghost:</b> By morning you will be gone and I will have to invent another one of you. </p>

<h1>Question 1</h1>
<br>
    <p><i>Suddenly, the ghost gets very excited! He starts hopping around and clapping his hands together.</i></p>
    <p><i>You don't understand what is going on as you quietly witness the ghost being giddy.</i></p>
<br>
    
    <p><b>Ghost:</b> FIIIIRST QUESTION!</p>
    <p><b>Ghost:</b> What is your earliest memory?</p>
<br>
     <p><i>You take a moment to remember. A lot of things come to your mind..</i></p>
    <br>
    <p>..but somehow you picture a kid gathering shells at the beach.</p>
    <p>It is you!</p>
    <p>There is not a single cloud in the sky and the ocean is calm.</p>
    <p>You look towards the ocean and see what seems to be your parents!</p>
    <p>They are waving at you! And in that moment - You are happy. </p>
<br>
    <p>You try to remember more, but the memory fades..</p>

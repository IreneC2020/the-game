<h1>Question 4</h1>

<br>
    <p><i>..with a soft voice, the ghost asks:</i></p>
    <p><b>Ghost:</b> Last question..</p>
    <p><b>Ghost:</b> How did you die?</p>
<br>
     <p><i>A rush of emotions come through you - saddness, happiness, love, hate!</i></p>
     <p><i>It is almost too much for you to handle, but you cannot back down now.</i></p>
<br>
    <p>You see a room, the same room you are in right now.</p>
    <p>It is your bedroom.</p>
    <p>Your first love is now your wife and she is sleeping right next to you.</p>
    <p>You are at peace. Up to that moment you have lived a good life and nothing can go wrong.</p>
     <p><i>You blink.</i></p>
    <p>The room is on fire.</p>
    <p>You try waking up your wife</p>
    <p>She is not responding - you are scared to death.</p>
    <p>The windows won't open, the door is blocked</p>
    <p>The fire is engulfing everything.</p>
    <p>You hear sirens and firefighters coming up the stairs</p>
    <p>There is hope!</p>
    <p>With your last strenght, you manage to squeeze your wife through the door..</p>
    <p>..but it is too late for you.</p>

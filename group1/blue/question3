    <p><b>Ghost:</b> Who was your first child?</p>
<br>
     <p><i>You don't understand..You are.. a father?</i></p>
     <p><i>Before you can even question this..</i></p>
    <p>Everybody is screaming: It's a boy! You are holding a new born. </p>
    <p><i>The memory is like a flash.</i></p>
    <p>You see the same baby smiling for the first time. You feel true love.</p>
    <p><i>The memory skips.</i></p>
    <p>The same child is taking his first steps. You are scared but happy.</p>
    <p><i>The memory keeps jumping forward.</i></p>
    <p>You build a tree house for him. You are both laughing.</p>
    <p><i>Things start getting blurry but it stops when..</i></p>
    <p>You see your son graduating - you are so proud.</p>
    
    <p>You are left speachless, and start feeling sad..</p>
<br>
    <p><i>You look at the ghost and see his excitement is gone.</i></p>

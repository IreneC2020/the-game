    <p>Then, you realize you need to find something to eat...you are hungry now</p>
    <p>Let go explore this area.....</p>
    <p>You take a walk around the island to find food</p>
    <p>Then you see the cave...</p>
    <p>It looks dark, but you may need a place to stay over night.</p>
    <p>You slowly enter the cave and you see two gems: red and blue</p>
    <p>They look like the gems that the ghost showed you</p>
    <p>Which one will you choose this time??????</p>

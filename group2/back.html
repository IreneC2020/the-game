<!--Fit your item into the description-->
<p>Laid out before you is a room filled with all sorts of items. There is a dresser to the right of you. A door is to the left of you. You see a chalice on the dresser. In the corner seemingly surrounded by darkness is an old-worn sofa which seems to drink in the light.
<p>What will you do now?</p>
<ul>
    <li><a href="/jaize/jaize.html">Grab the chalice</a></li>
